## AirBnB Clone Project - README

**Project Overview**

This project outlines the development of a backend for an Airbnb clone application. We'll be using Python with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and leverage a MySQL database with SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

**Project Duration:**

March 15, 2024 (6:00 AM) - March 21, 2024 (6:00 AM)

**Learning Objectives:**

* Implement unit testing for robust code.
* Utilize `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexible function arguments.
* Handle named arguments effectively in functions.
* Manage MySQL databases and user creation.
* Understand ORM concepts and class-to-table mapping.
* Design a codebase that works with different storage engines.
* Leverage environment variables for configuration.

**Requirements:**

* **Coding Environment:**
    * Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    * Text editors: vi, vim, or emacs
    * Consistent newlines and `#!/usr/bin/python3` shebang
    * `README.md` file (this file!)
    * Adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines (using pycodestyle 2.8.+)
    * Executable Python files
    * Documented modules, classes, and functions with docstrings
* **Testing:**
    * Unit tests written using the `unittest` module
    * Tests located in the `tests` directory (e.g., `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`)
    * Testable using `python3 -m unittest discover tests` or individual files
* **Database:**
    * MySQL 8.0 database
    * Commented SQL queries for clarity
    * Descriptive comments explaining tasks within SQL scripts
* **Version Control:**
    * Unique GitHub repository per team

**Getting Started:**

1. **Review Resources:** Familiarize yourselves with the recommended resources.
2. **Development Environment Setup:** Install Python, MySQL, and a Git client for version control.
3. **Data Model Design:** Design the data model for your Airbnb clone, considering users, listings, bookings, etc.
4. **Model Implementation:** Implement Python classes for these models using OOP principles.
5. **ORM Mapping:** Utilize SQLAlchemy to map the classes to MySQL tables.
6. **Storage Layer Development:** Develop a storage layer using environment variables to handle different storage engines (file-based or database).
7. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your code.
8. **Database Schema Creation:** Create SQL scripts to set up the database schema.
9. **Code Documentation:** Document your code thoroughly using comments and docstrings.
10. **Version Control:** Push your code to your team's GitHub repository.

**Collaboration and Plagiarism:**

* Avoid plagiarism and work together effectively to achieve the learning objectives.

**Coding Style and Maintainability:**

* Focus on clear, concise, and well-documented code that adheres to best practices.

**Testing:**

* Utilize unit testing to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

**Meeting Deadlines:**

* Strive to meet all project requirements by the deadline.
